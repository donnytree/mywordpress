===========

I have been developing and programming in Wordpress for several years. I reuse a lot of the same code, and thought I would post some here that you might find helpful. Caveat: a lot of this code is hacked from other places, useful resources include http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/, http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference, and http://stackoverflow.com/
